# CitationGenerator

> **CitationGenerator**: The tool is designed for Zlin's students to simplify citation management. 


## Features ðŸŽ¯

CitationGenerator has two modes, controlled by setting `GetPDF` in `docx_gen.py`. You can set `GetPDF=True` to crawl citation PDF files and generate the Word document (note that some PDF files require database access and cannot be crawled). Alternatively, you can set `GetPDF=False` to generate the Word document directly using only local citation PDF files.

I advise you to **run the `docx_gen.py` with `GetPDF=True` first** to download part of the PDF files and get an initial Word document. Then, **download the remaining PDFs manually using the web hyperlinks in the Word document**. After that, **run with `GetPDF=False`** to generate the final Word document. This way, you won't even need to manually adjust the hyperlinks in the Word document.
